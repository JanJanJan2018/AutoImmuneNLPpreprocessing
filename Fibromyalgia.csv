I took #Lyrica for 6 months as an early #UNKNOWN treatment and it was terrible. It has no affect on #pain, but high addiction and suicide risk. #Pfizer should pull it off the market.
This popular drug is linked to addiction and suicide. Why do doctors keep prescribing it?
Emma Phillips, 39, was given the nerve-pain drug pregabalin, sold by Pfizer as Lyrica, in 2016. Her GP wrote her a prescription to help with her viral meningitis, she says.
