Would you consider a #Chrons disease treatment that involved parasitic worms?

Would You Swallow a Worm to Treat Crohn's?
Helminthic therapy looks promising in animal studies, but parasitic worms haven’t yet been proven safe or effective in humans. Learn more about the treatment.

#kratom also assists with treatment of Chrons Disease, to the point where it is tolerable. Another ailment #kratom can make more bearable. Why is this Kratom GOOSE CHASE still an issue? If it helps ONE PERSON live a better life, it should remain legal, regulated, & available.

The binding properties of it has resolved the problem I have with Crohn's disease, so i live a normal life. Not to mention how it eases the depression associated with the disease and IBD as well.","Chron's Disease"
