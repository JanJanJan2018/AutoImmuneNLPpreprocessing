Gluten is found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye

Yes, it’s real.  Yes, I have it.  Your doctor can run a blood test to see if you body is generating the antibodies that indicate UNKNOWN disease.   My antibody levels were so high that they were off the charts. Only treatment is 100% gluten free diet.","Celiac Disease"

UNKNOWN Disease is very real. Incident rate of about 1 in 100 people. Serious autoimmune disease with significant health impacts if left untreated. Only treatment is adherence to a strict gluten free diet. For people like me a gluten free diet is a necessity not a fad.","Celiac Disease"

Encountered a Tweeter who said they’d forgo UNKNOWN treatment if ever invented because clearly our genetics intended for us to go without gluten. But we’re 1% of the population? and we have an autoimmune disease? Fun fact — without vaccines, we’re all predisposed to smallpox.
